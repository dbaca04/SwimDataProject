# Testing Notes for Swim Data Project

This document captures key issues, findings, and solutions discovered during testing of the Swim Data Project.

## April 24, 2025 - Initial Testing

### Environment Setup Issues

#### Python Version Compatibility
- **Issue**: Newer Python versions (3.13) have compatibility issues with some packages requiring C extensions.
- **Solution**: Focus on core functionality with minimal dependencies or pin to a more stable Python version (3.9-3.11).
- **Affected Packages**: 
  - pandas: Failed to build with Python 3.13 due to issues with meson build system
  - Some of the advanced data science packages may require specific build tools

#### Build Dependencies
- **Issue**: Some packages require C/C++ compiler for installation.
- **Solution**: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools or equivalent for local development.
- **Note**: For Docker deployment, include necessary build tools in the build stage but exclude them from the final runtime image.

### Database Layer

#### SQLite for Development
- **Finding**: SQLite works well for development and testing.
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple setup with no additional services required
  - Handles relationships properly
  - Fast for basic operations
- **Cons**:
  - Not suitable for production use with concurrent access
  - Limited advanced features compared to PostgreSQL

#### SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Finding**: SQLAlchemy ORM models are working as expected.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep relationship definitions bidirectional for easier querying
  - Use proper cascading options for deletions
  - Consider lazy loading strategy for production performance

### API Layer

#### Pydantic V2 Changes
- **Issue**: Pydantic V2 has breaking changes from V1.
- **Solution**: Updated code to use newer APIs:
  - Replaced `BaseSettings` import from `pydantic` with import from `pydantic_settings`
  - Changed Config class to use `model_config` dict
  - Renamed `orm_mode` to `from_attributes`

#### FastAPI Performance
- **Finding**: FastAPI performs well with SQLite and minimal data.
- **To Monitor**:
  - Response times with larger datasets
  - Memory usage under load
  - Connection pooling when connecting to PostgreSQL

### Scraper Layer

#### Anti-Detection Measures
- **Finding**: Modern websites have increasingly sophisticated bot detection.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Implement user agent rotation
  - Add random delays between requests
  - Mimic browser behavior (headers, cookies, etc.)
  - Consider using proxy rotation for production

#### Selenium Setup
- **Issue**: Selenium requires WebDriver installation.
- **Solution**: Using webdriver-manager package to automate driver installation.
- **Docker Consideration**: Include proper Chrome/Firefox installation in Docker image.

## Action Items for Production

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Create PostgreSQL database schema
   - Set up connection pooling for API server
   - Implement proper migration scripts

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test API with large datasets (10,000+ records)
   - Measure response times for common queries
   - Optimize SQL queries as needed

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Add proper authentication to API
   - Implement rate limiting for external access
   - Secure database connections

4. **Scraper Resilience**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add logging and monitoring
   - Set up retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

5. **Docker Deployment**:
   - Create multi-stage builds to reduce image size
   - Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - Consider Kubernetes for production scaling
