# Project Planning

## Project Goals and Scope

### Primary Goals

1. **Create a comprehensive swimming data platform** that provides accurate rankings and comparative analytics for high school swimmers.

2. **Enable multi-level comparisons** allowing swimmers to assess their standing at city, state, regional, national, and international levels.

3. **Provide performance gap analysis** between high school swimmers and elite/Olympic swimmers to illustrate development pathways.

4. **Deliver actionable insights** through data visualization and analytic tools.

### Project Scope

#### In Scope
- Web scraping of publicly available swimming data sources
- Storage and normalization of swimming times and rankings
- Development of comparative analytics and visualization tools
- Creation of a user-friendly web interface
- Focus on high school swimming with benchmarking against elite levels

#### Out of Scope (Initial Phase)
- Mobile application development
- Real-time data streaming
- Partnerships with swimming organizations
- Training recommendation systems
- Video analysis features

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data source blocks web scraping | High | Medium | Implement ethical scraping practices, use proxy rotation, respect robots.txt |
| Inconsistent data formats | Medium | High | Develop robust normalization algorithms, implement quality verification |
| Duplicate swimmer records | Medium | High | Create sophisticated deduplication algorithms based on multiple factors |
| Performance/scaling issues | Medium | Medium | Design efficient database schema, implement caching, use incremental updates |
| Legal concerns regarding scraped data | High | Low | Only use publicly available data, provide attribution, no commercial use of raw data |

## Initial Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Research & Planning | 2 weeks | Analyze data sources, define architecture, create scraping strategy |
| Proof of Concept | 3 weeks | Build initial scrapers, create database schema, verify data quality |
| Core Development | 8 weeks | Implement comprehensive scraping, build analytics engine, create basic UI |
| UI Development | 6 weeks | Design and implement complete user interface and visualization tools |
| Testing & Refinement | 4 weeks | System testing, performance optimization, bug fixing |
| Initial Release | - | Launch of first public version |
