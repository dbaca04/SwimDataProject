## Integration Strategy

To create a comprehensive database from these diverse sources:

1. **Primary data acquisition**:
   - USA Swimming for core US swimming data
   - NISCA for high school-specific records and rankings
   - State athletic associations for detailed state-level results

2. **Secondary/enrichment data**:
   - SwimCloud for additional context and analysis
   - SwimRankings.net for international benchmarking
   - SwimStandards for time standards and additional verification

3. **Data reconciliation process**:
   - Create unified swimmer profiles using name/team/age matching
   - Resolve duplicates through timestamp and source prioritization
   - Flag conflicting data for manual review
   - Maintain source attribution for all data points

4. **Update frequency strategy**:
   - Daily: High-traffic, frequently updated sources
   - Weekly: Secondary sources and verification
   - Seasonal: State athletic association data (aligned with competition schedule)
   - Annual: Sources like NISCA with annual publication cycles
