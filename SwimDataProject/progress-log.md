# Progress Log

This document serves as a chronological record of all work completed on the Swim Data Project. It will be updated as milestones are reached and significant progress is made.

## April 6, 2025

### Project Initialization

- Created project directory structure at `C:\Users\dbaca\Source\Repos\USA Swim\SwimDataProject`
- Established core documentation:
  - README.md (project overview and table of contents)
  - 01-project-planning.md (project goals, scope, and target audiences)
  - 02-data-sources.md (analysis of available swimming data sources)
  - 03-web-scraping-strategy.md (approach to data collection)
  - 04-data-architecture.md (database schema and data management)
  - 05-implementation-plan.md (development phases and technical architecture)
  - progress-log.md (this document)

### Research Findings

- Identified key swimming data sources:
  - USA Swimming Data Hub: Comprehensive but no public API
  - NISCA: High school-specific records and rankings
  - State Athletic Associations: State-level competition results
  - SwimCloud: Additional rankings and analytics
  - SwimStandards: Time standards and additional data
  - SwimRankings.net: International comparison data

- Analyzed technical accessibility of each source:
  - Most sources require web scraping (no open APIs available)
  - Data formats vary significantly between sources
  - Multiple sources needed for comprehensive coverage

### Initial Architecture Decisions

- Selected PostgreSQL as primary database
- Chose Python ecosystem for scraping and data processing
- Planned React-based frontend with visualization libraries
- Designed modular architecture with separation of concerns:
  - Web scraping layer
  - Data processing layer
  - API layer
  - Frontend application

### Next Steps

- Set up development environment with Docker
- Create repository structure and initial code framework
- Implement database schema
- Develop proof-of-concept scraper for USA Swimming Data Hub

## April 7, 2025

### Repository Structure Implementation

- Established directory structure following the planned architecture:
  - `/scrapers`: Web scraping modules
  - `/database`: Database modules and migrations
  - `/analysis`: Data analysis tools (placeholder)
  - `/web/backend`: Backend API implementation
  - `/web/frontend`: Frontend application (placeholder)

- Created core configuration files:
  - `.gitignore` for Git version control
  - `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
  - `.env.example` for environment configuration

### Scraper Implementation

- Created base scraper framework (`base_scraper.py`):
  - Session management with rotating user agents
  - Rate limiting capabilities
  - Proxy rotation support
  - Error handling and logging

- Implemented USA Swimming scraper (`usa_swimming_scraper.py`):
  - Selenium-based browser automation for form interaction
  - Anti-detection measures for web scraping
  - Structured data extraction methods
  - Initial data saving functionality

### Database Implementation

- Created SQLAlchemy ORM models for all entities:
  - Swimmers, Teams, Events, Meets
  - Swim Times, Rankings, Time Standards
  - Support for aliases and source mappings
  - Comprehensive relationships between entities

- Implemented database utilities:
  - Connection management
  - Session handling
  - Migration support with Alembic
  - Database initialization scripts

- Created test data seeding functionality:
  - Basic records for all entity types
  - Relationships between entities

### API Implementation

- Set up FastAPI framework:
  - Route modules for all entity types
  - Pydantic models for request/response validation
  - Documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger
  - CORS and middleware configuration

- Implemented comprehensive endpoints:
  - CRUD operations for all entities
  - Filtering and pagination support
  - Specialized endpoints for common queries
    - Personal best times
    - Leaderboards
    - Team rosters

### Next Steps

- Set up Docker containerization
- Implement the database migrations
- Complete the USA Swimming scraper with real data extraction
- Begin frontend implementation
- Develop entity resolution for deduplication
