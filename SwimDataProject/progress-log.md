# Progress Log

This document serves as a chronological record of all work completed on the Swim Data Project. It will be updated as milestones are reached and significant progress is made.

## April 6, 2025

### Project Initialization

- Created project directory structure at `C:\Users\dbaca\Source\Repos\USA Swim\SwimDataProject`
- Established core documentation:
  - README.md (project overview and table of contents)
  - 01-project-planning.md (project goals, scope, and target audiences)
  - 02-data-sources.md (analysis of available swimming data sources)
  - 03-web-scraping-strategy.md (approach to data collection)
  - 04-data-architecture.md (database schema and data management)
  - 05-implementation-plan.md (development phases and technical architecture)
  - progress-log.md (this document)

### Research Findings

- Identified key swimming data sources:
  - USA Swimming Data Hub: Comprehensive but no public API
  - NISCA: High school-specific records and rankings
  - State Athletic Associations: State-level competition results
  - SwimCloud: Additional rankings and analytics
  - SwimStandards: Time standards and additional data
  - SwimRankings.net: International comparison data

- Analyzed technical accessibility of each source:
  - Most sources require web scraping (no open APIs available)
  - Data formats vary significantly between sources
  - Multiple sources needed for comprehensive coverage

### Initial Architecture Decisions

- Selected PostgreSQL as primary database
- Chose Python ecosystem for scraping and data processing
- Planned React-based frontend with visualization libraries
- Designed modular architecture with separation of concerns:
  - Web scraping layer
  - Data processing layer
  - API layer
  - Frontend application

### Next Steps

- Set up development environment with Docker
- Create repository structure and initial code framework
- Implement database schema
- Develop proof-of-concept scraper for USA Swimming Data Hub

## April 24, 2025

### Development Environment Setup & Testing

- Created Python virtual environment for development
- Experienced compatibility issues with modern Python (3.13) and some packages:
  - Issues with Pandas and complex data science packages requiring C extensions
  - Focused on core functionality with minimal dependencies

- Successfully installed core dependencies:
  - FastAPI and Uvicorn for API server
  - SQLAlchemy for database ORM
  - Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping
  - Pydantic for data validation

- Made necessary adaptations for Pydantic v2:
  - Updated Settings configuration in config.py
  - Changed `orm_mode` to `from_attributes` in models

### Database Testing

- Successfully initialized SQLite database:
  - Created all schema tables
  - Verified foreign key relationships
  - Populated with test data

- Tested database operations:
  - Swimmers, events, teams, and meets correctly stored
  - Swim times with proper relationships to other entities
  - Basic query functionality working as expected

### API Testing

- Successfully started FastAPI server
- Tested endpoints with curl:
  - GET /api/swimmers - Returned all seeded swimmers
  - GET /api/events - Returned all configured events
  - GET /api/times - Returned swim times with related entities

- Verified API documentation at /docs endpoint:
  - OpenAPI/Swagger UI working correctly
  - All endpoints properly documented
  - Request/response models correctly defined

### Key Findings

- Architecture design proved sound:
  - Clean separation of scraping, database, and API layers
  - Well-defined data models and relationships
  - Comprehensive API covering all required functionality

- Development environment considerations:
  - Some packages require specific build tools for compilation (VS C++ tools)
  - Compatibility issues with latest Python versions may require version pinning
  - Environment variables and configuration management working well

- SQLite sufficient for development but PostgreSQL will be needed for production:
  - SQLite handles relationships and basic operations well
  - More complex queries and concurrent access will need PostgreSQL

### Next Steps

1. **Production Database Setup**:
   - Configure PostgreSQL for production environment
   - Create migration scripts for schema evolution

2. **Scraper Implementation**:
   - Add actual data extraction logic to USA Swimming scraper
   - Test against live data sources with rate limiting
   - Implement proper error handling for production

3. **Docker Setup**:
   - Containerize application components
   - Create multi-container setup with docker-compose
   - Include PostgreSQL in container setup

4. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up React application structure
   - Create UI components for data visualization
   - Implement API client for data retrieval
