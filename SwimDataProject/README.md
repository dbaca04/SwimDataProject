# Swim Data Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive swimming data platform focused on high school swimmers, allowing them to compare their performance against peers at the city, state, regional, national, and international levels. Our approach relies on web scraping to collect data from various public sources, as we currently don't have partnerships with swimming organizations.
